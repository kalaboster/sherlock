I kill dandelions.
I enjoy killing dandelions.
I pop the heads-off dandelions.
I loath dandelions.
I love loathing dandelions.
I murder dandelions.
I pull dandelions.
I weed dandelions.
I dig dandelions.
I obsess dandelions.
I pick-on dandelions.
I ridicule dandelions.
I eulogize dandelions.
I reap dandelions.
I burn dandelions.
I trap dandelions.
I pluck dandelions.
I smash dandelions.
I shove Joe from the road.
The bus drives at Joe.
I cut the dog.
The snake poison drains from it.
Johnny pushes me.
Don slapped Sue.
His hand smashed the mosquito.
Johnny can rob a bank.
